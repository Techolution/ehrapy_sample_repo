7,1,2079-01-01, Rheumatology,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 71-year-old female who I am seeing for the first time.  She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.  Currently, she has no pain in any of her joints.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Denies photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcer, seizure, psychosis, and skin rashes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left BKA.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  BP 130/70, heart rate 80, and respiratory rate 14.,HEENT:  EOMI.

She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.",2079,1,F,2018-01-01,2018,61

18,3,2075-01-01, Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.",2075,3,M,2018-01-01,2018,57

Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.",2075,3,M,2018-01-01,2018,57

History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.

Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.

We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.

However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.",2061,7,F,2018-01-01,2018,43

On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial).  The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade.  The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging.  She prior to that area, denied any complaints.  She had no nipple discharge.  No trauma history.  She has had been on no estrogen supplementation.  She has had no other personal history of breast cancer.  Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48.  The patient has had no children and no pregnancies.  She denies any change in the right breast.  Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy.  The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning.  The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact.  CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.,ALLERGIES:,  SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.

The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality.  The right breast is without abnormality.  The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without masses.  No gross organomegaly.  No CVA or flank tenderness.,EXTREMITIES:  Grossly neurovascularly intact.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.",2065,9,F,2018-01-01,2018,47

The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.

95,13,2071-01-01, Hematology - Oncology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.,HISTORY: , A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.

101,13,2071-01-01, Hematology - Oncology,"REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.,HISTORY: , A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.,ALLERGIES: , THE PATIENT STATES THAT ON OCCASION LORAZEPAM DOSE PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS, AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY TOLERATING ATIVAN.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's height is 165 cm, weight is 77 kg.

143,19,2051-01-01, General Medicine,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 43-year-old male who was recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.,MEDICATIONS:, Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.,HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.,NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.,CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.,ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.,PLAN:, The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.",2051,19,M,2018-01-01,2018,33

He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.,",2051,19,M,2018-01-01,2018,33

He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.  He associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy Mexican food., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Reviewed and unchanged.,ALLERGIES: , No known allergies to medications.,OPERATIONS: , Unchanged.,ILLNESSES: , Crohn's disease, vitamin B12 deficiency.,MEDICATIONS:,  Imuran, Nascobal, Vicodin p.r.n., ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted.  Please see pertinent GI issues as discussed above.  Otherwise unremarkable., ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  , GENERAL:  Pleasant male in no acute distress.  Well nourished and well developed. SKIN: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length.  Non-tender to palpation. No erythema or red streaking.  No edema. LYMPH:  No epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side. , ,DATA REVIEWED: Labs from June 8th and July 19th reviewed.  Liver function tests normal with AST 14 and ALT 44.  WBCs were slightly low at 4.8.  Hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. Hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  These results were reviewed by Dr. S and lab results letter sent., ,IMPRESSION:  ,1. Crohn's disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on Imuran.  Intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  Last episode three weeks ago.,2.  History of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of Tylenol.  Now resolved. ,2.  Increased frequency of reflux symptoms.,3.  Superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. ,4.  Slightly low H&H., ,PLAN:  ,1.  We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. ,2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.,3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.,4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. ,5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  Reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  He does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.,6.",2054,34,M,2018-01-01,2018,36

279,35,2036-01-01, Consult - History and Phy.,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 28-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy.  Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy.  She did use insulin at that time as well.  She does not fully understand what ketones are.  She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week’s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient’s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient’s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.  Provided my name and number should there be additional dietary questions.",2036,35,F,2018-01-01,2018,18

283,36,2058-01-01, Consult - History and Phy.,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain.  Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he ""felt it"" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.,The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.,The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.,MEDICATIONS: , In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin.,ALLERGIES:,  HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his wife.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is elevated at 105.  Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,BACK:  Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left.  There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion.  There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling.  Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg.  There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a ""good day.""  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a ""bad day,"" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.  Chronic back pain.,PLAN: , At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible.  Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex.  He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet.  I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally.  If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.",2058,36,M,2018-01-01,2018,40

359,48,2046-01-01, SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.

The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.

The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

The patient smokes 1-1/2 packs of cigarettes a day and does not have a history of regular exercise routine.,OBJECTIVE: , Upon observation, the patient is a very obese female who is ambulating with significant antalgic gait pattern and altered normal gait due to the pain as well as the walking boot.  Upon inspection of the left ankle, it appears to have swelling, unsure if this swelling is secondary to injury or water retention as the patient states she has significant water retention.  When compared to right ankle edema, it is approximately equal.  There is no evidence of discoloration or temperature.  The patient states that she had no bruising at the time of injury.,Active range of motion of left ankle is as follows:  Dorsiflexion is 6 degrees past neutral and plantar flexion is 54 degrees, eversion 20 degrees, and inversion is 30 degrees.

She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.",2039,60,F,2018-01-01,2018,21

The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

482,64,2046-01-01, Consult - History and Phy.,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",2046,64,F,2018-01-01,2018,28

491,67,2070-01-01, SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.

As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.

Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.",2070,67,F,2018-01-01,2018,52

She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.

The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.

536,71,2070-01-01, SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",2070,71,F,2018-01-01,2018,52
537,71,2070-01-01, SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.

No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.

Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.",2070,71,F,2018-01-01,2018,52

549,76,2055-01-01, Consult - History and Phy.,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  ,Followup of seizures.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002.  At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.  She reports no seizures in the past several years.  She currently is without complaint.,In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures.  There is no family history of seizures.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Remarkable only for hypertension in her father.  Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She works running a day care at home.  She has three children.  She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Please see note in chart.  Only endorses weight gain and the history of seizures, as well as some minor headaches treated with over-the-counter medications.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide.,ALLERGIES: , Flagyl and aspirin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure is 138/88, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 18, and weight is 224 pounds, pain scale is none.,General Examination:  Please see note in chart, which is essentially unremarkable except mild obesity.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: , Again, please see note in chart.  Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.  There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit.  Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities.  Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap.,She rises easily from the chair.

Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles.,She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago.  CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006.  The findings were within the range of normal variation.

At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.",2064,77,F,2018-01-01,2018,46

At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is originally from Maine.  She has lived in Arizona for 4 years.  She has had 2 children; however, only one is living.  She had one child died from complications of ulcerative colitis.

602,87,2046-01-01, Consult - History and Phy.,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",2046,87,F,2018-01-01,2018,28

608,89,2075-01-01, Letters,"Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.",2075,89,M,2018-01-01,2018,57

613,89,2075-01-01, Letters,"Dear Sample Doctor:,Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation.  This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND.  He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  He has never been a smoker.  He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA.  He had his gallbladder removed.  No bleeding tendencies.  No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism.  The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema).,Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position.  He is in no distress.  Venous pressure is normal.  Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam was normal.  The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  There were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  There was no peripheral edema.  ,He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  Renal function was normal.  His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL.  His sodium was a little bit increased.  His A1c hemoglobin was increased.  He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.  ,He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal.  He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG.  There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging.,In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.  ,In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  He also should start aggressively losing weight.  I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.  ,In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix.  The patient is allergic to aspirin.  I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should.  This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide.  If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular.,I do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms.,If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.,Thank you once again for this kind referral.,Sincerely,,Sample Doctor, M.D.",2075,89,M,2018-01-01,2018,57

The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.

She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.

She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.",2079,92,F,2018-01-01,2018,61

With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.

He has also been seen by me in the clinic in the last few weeks.  He was admitted on January 18, 2008, with recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  On the same day, he underwent VATS and thoracoscopic drainage of the pleural effusion with right pleural nodule biopsy, lysis of adhesions, and directed talc insufflation by Dr. X.  He was found to have 2.5L of bloody pleural effusions, some loculated pleural effusion, adhesions, and carcinomatosis in the parenchyma.  His hospital course here has been significant for dyspnea, requiring ICU stay.  He also had a chest tube, which was taken out few days ago.  He has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he has been on amiodarone by cardiologist.  The biopsy from the pleural nodule done on the right on January 18, 2008, shows malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma.  Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for calretinin and focally positive for D2-40, MOC-31.  Tumor cells are negative for CDX-2, and monoclonal CEA.,The patient at this time reports that overall he has been feeling better with decrease in shortness of breath and cough over the last few days.  He does have edema in his lower extremities.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, recent change in bowel habit, melena, or hematochezia.  No neurological or musculoskeletal signs or symptoms.  He reports that he is able to ambulate to the bathroom, but gets short of breath on exertion.  He denies any other complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction as per the previous echocardiogram done in December 2007, history of pneumonia in December 2007, admitted to XYZ Hospital.  History of recurrent pleural effusions, status post pleurodesis and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer as per the biopsy that was done in XYZ Hospital.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,In the hospital are amiodarone, diltiazem, enoxaparin, furosemide, methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, Zosyn, p.r.n. acetaminophen, and hydrocodone.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his spouse.  He has history of tobacco smoking and also reports history of alcohol abuse.  No history of illicit drug abuse.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Significant for history of ?cancer? in the mother and history of coronary artery disease in the father.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As stated above.  He denies any obvious asbestos exposure, as far as he can remember.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  He is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 97/65 mmHg, respiration is 20 per minute, pulse is 72 per minute, and temperature 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.,HEENT:  No icterus or sinus tenderness.  Oral mucosa is moist.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation except few diffuse wheezing present bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, and nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral pedal edema is present in both the extremities.

Liver enzymes checked on January 17, 2008, were unremarkable.  CBC done on January 26, 2008, showed WBC of 19.8, hemoglobin of 10.7, hematocrit of 30.8, and platelet count of 515,000.  Chest x-ray from yesterday shows right-sided Port-A-Cath, diffuse right lung parenchymal and pleural infiltration without change, mild pulmonary vascular congestion.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Mesothelioma versus primary lung carcinoma, two separate reports as for the two separate biopsies done several weeks apart.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,4.  Malignant pleural effusion, status post surgery as stated above.,5.  Anemia of chronic disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Compare the slides from the previous biopsy done in December at XYZ Hospital with recurrent pleural nodule biopsy slides.  I have discussed regarding this with Dr. Y in Pathology here at Methodist XYZ Hospital.  I will try to obtain the slides for comparison from XYZ Hospital for comparison and immunohistochemical staining.,2.  I will also discuss with Dr. X and also with intervention radiologist at XYZ Hospital regarding the exact sites of the two biopsies.,3.  Once the results of the above are available, I will make further recommendations regarding treatment.  The patient has significantly decreased performance status with dyspnea on exertion and is being planned for transfer to Triumph Hospital for rehab, which I agree with.,4.  Continue present care.,Discussed regarding the above in great details with the patient and his wife and daughter and answered the questions to their satisfaction.  They clearly understand the above.  They also understand his very poor performance status at this time, and the risks and benefits of delaying chemotherapy due to this.",2081,101,M,2018-01-01,2018,63

An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

He has also been seen by me in the clinic in the last few weeks.  He was admitted on January 18, 2008, with recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  On the same day, he underwent VATS and thoracoscopic drainage of the pleural effusion with right pleural nodule biopsy, lysis of adhesions, and directed talc insufflation by Dr. X.  He was found to have 2.5L of bloody pleural effusions, some loculated pleural effusion, adhesions, and carcinomatosis in the parenchyma.  His hospital course here has been significant for dyspnea, requiring ICU stay.  He also had a chest tube, which was taken out few days ago.  He has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he has been on amiodarone by cardiologist.  The biopsy from the pleural nodule done on the right on January 18, 2008, shows malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma.  Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for calretinin and focally positive for D2-40, MOC-31.  Tumor cells are negative for CDX-2, and monoclonal CEA.,The patient at this time reports that overall he has been feeling better with decrease in shortness of breath and cough over the last few days.  He does have edema in his lower extremities.  He is currently on 4L of oxygen.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, recent change in bowel habit, melena, or hematochezia.  No neurological or musculoskeletal signs or symptoms.  He reports that he is able to ambulate to the bathroom, but gets short of breath on exertion.  He denies any other complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction as per the previous echocardiogram done in December 2007, history of pneumonia in December 2007, admitted to XYZ Hospital.

The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.

Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.,3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.,BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.",2038,105,F,2018-01-01,2018,20

After leaving ABCD approximately 01/25/2010, she stopped taking her Abilify and lithium.  Her husband states that he restrained her from jumping, ""so she would not kill herself,"" and this was taken as a statement in his affidavit.  The patient was taken to X Hospital, medically cleared, given Ativan 2 mg p.o. and transferred on an involuntary status to XYZ Hospital.  She arrives here and is today pacing on the unit and in and out of the large TV room area.

AM and 600 mg p.o. q.p.m., Abilify 15 mg p.o. per day, Lyrica 100 mg p.o. per day, it is not clear if she is taking Geodon as the record is conflicting in this regard.  She is being given Vicodin, is not sure who the prescriber for that medication is and it is presumably due to her history of herniated disc.  Of note, she also has a history of abusing Vicodin.,ALLERGIES:  ,Said to be PENICILLIN, LAMICTAL, and ZYPREXA.,SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with her husband.

Her recent, intermediate, and remote memory are impaired although there is a lack of cooperation in this testing.,JUDGMENT AND INSIGHT:,  Nil.  When asked, are there situations when you lose control, she refuses to answer.  When asked, are meds helpful, she refuses to answer.  She refuses to give her family information nor release of information to contact them.,ASSETS:,  The patient has an outpatient psychiatrist and she does better or is more stable when taking her medications.,LIMITATIONS:,  The patient goes off her medications routinely, behaves unsafely and in a potentially suicidal manner.,FORMULATION,:  The patient has bipolar affective disorder in a manic state at present.

It cleared for awhile.  This has been an intermittent problem.  Now it is back again on his right lower abdomen.  At first, it was thought that he may have early zoster.  This started six weeks before the holidays and is still going on, more so in the past eight days on his abdomen and right hip area.

Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg.

It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.",2057,114,M,2018-01-01,2018,39

Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.",2042,116,M,2018-01-01,2018,24

Since this point in time, he has been unwilling to let his blood sugars fall within a normal range, for fear of hypoglycemia. Also reports that he regulates his blood sugars with how he feels, rarely checking his blood sugar with a glucometer., ,Reports that he has been worked up extensively at hospital and was seeing an Endocrinologist at one time.  Reports that he had some indications of kidney damage when first diagnosed.  His urine microalbumin today is 100.  His last hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9.  Reports that at one point, he was on Lantus which worked well and he did not worry about his blood sugars dropping too low. While using Lantus, he was able to get his hemoglobin A1C down to 7.  His last CMP shows an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 168. He denies alcohol or drug use and is a non smoker.  Reports he quit drinking 3 years ago.

The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.,2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.

In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.",2042,125,M,2018-01-01,2018,24

At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is originally from Maine.  She has lived in Arizona for 4 years.  She has had 2 children; however, only one is living.  She had one child died from complications of ulcerative colitis.

958,131,2095-01-01, Rheumatology,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Regarding weakness and a history of polymyositis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is an 87-year-old white female who gives a history of polymyositis diagnosed in 1993. The patient did have biopsy of the quadriceps muscle performed at that time which, per her account, did show an abnormality. She was previously followed by Dr. C, neurology, over several years but was last followed up in the last three to four years. She is also seeing Dr. R at rheumatology in the past. Initially, she was treated with steroids but apparently was intolerant of that. She was given other therapy but she is unclear of the details of that. She has had persistent weakness of the bilateral lower extremities and has ambulated with the assistance of a walker for many years. She has also had a history of spine disease though the process there is not known to me at this time.,She presented on February 1, 2006 with productive cough, fevers and chills, left flank rash and pain there as well as profound weakness. Since admission, she has been diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonic process as well as shingles and is on therapy for both. She reports that strength in the proximal upper extremities has remained good. However, she has no grip strength. Apparently, this has been progressive over the last several years as well.

She also gives a history of spine disease though the details of that process are not available either.,The question raised at this time is of recurrence in inflammatory myopathy which would need to include not only polymyositis but also inclusion body myositis versus progressive spine disease versus weakness secondary to acute illness versus neuropathic process versus other.,3. Zoster of the left flank.,4. Left lower lobe pneumonic process.,5. Elevation of the thyroid stimulating hormone.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. I have asked Dr. C to see the patient and he has done so tonight.

964,133,2042-01-01, Psychiatry / Psychology,"IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT: , The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian female.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient's depression began in her teenage years.  Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  She sometimes has problems with motivation.  She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  She does not have suicidal thoughts.  ,The patient also has what she describes as going into a ""panic mode.""  During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  She does not get chest pain.  These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a ""time crunch."" ,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  The patient's nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,Caffeine:  The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.,Tobacco:  She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  She is still committed to quitting.,Alcohol: Denied.,Illicit drugs:  Denied.  In her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she ""came to"" when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse.,MEDICAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,Constitutional:  See History of Present Illness. No recent fever or sweats.",2042,133,F,2018-01-01,2018,24
